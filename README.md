# Sveltelette

CLI tool for simplifying development of small Svelte apps

## Overview

Let's say you have a folder full of `.svelte` files and you want to turn each one
into an `.html` document. There isn't really a good way to do it.

 

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g sveltelette
```

## Usage

When inside the folder you want to compile, just run:

```bash
sveltelette
```
